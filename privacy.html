                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>By Law or to Protect Rights:</strong> If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.</li>

                <p>
                    We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies on the Site to help customize the Site and improve your experience. When you access the Site, your personal information is not collected through the use of tracking technology. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can remove or reject cookies, but be aware that such action could affect the availability and functionality of the Site. You may not decline web beacons. However, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or by modifying your web browser’s settings to notify you each time a cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-800">5. Security of Your Information</h2>
                <p>
                    We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-800">6. Policy for Children</h2>
                <p>
                    We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-800">7. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
                <p>
                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-800">8. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
